Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. Must go faster. So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs?

I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?

God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist?

Life finds a way. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. I was part of something special. I was part of something special. Just my luck, no ice. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.

Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. You really think you can fly that thing?
